# Data dictionary:,,,,,,,,
"# ""n"" ",,,,,,,,
"# ""X.R.hand""",X Right-handed,,is the number of right-handers observed in this sample.  This study observed 14 righties.,,,,,
"# ""L.hand"" ",Left-handed,,is the number of left-handed toads.  This is included for completeness in the presentation; the number of left-hnaded toads doesn't actually feed directly into any calcualtions.,,,,,
"#""prop.X"" ",proportion X,,is the proportion of frogs that are right handed.  This is calculated as the (number observed R-handed)/(total observed),,,,,
,,,"# so X/n, and in the actualy dataset = 14/18. =",,,,,
"# ""prob.X"" ",probability X,,"is the probability that, if our null is correct, how likely are we to end up with a sample of 14 right handers out of 18 due to chance.",,,,,
"# That is, if the population overall has a 50:50 ratio of right:left handed frogs, how likely are we to get a biased sample of 14 right handers and only 4 left handers.",,,,,,,,
